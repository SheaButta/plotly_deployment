## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to assist my client (Probable Beef (PB)) with producing a webstie using JavaScript.  My client has collected data in hopes to determine what species colonize an individual's belly button.  PB would like to understand the data in hopes of producing a protein that tastes like beef.  My first sprint delivered a site with a dashboard of demographic information of volunteers participating in this data collection.  PB, would like me to visualize the bacterial data for all their volunteers.

My final sprint will include adding three (3) specific visualization which are identified below.  As always, my analysis followed the data analysis principles of (1) Determine the number of rows and columns; (2) Data types used; and (3) Is the data readable?

__Client Expected Results:__
- Visualize the top 10 bacterial species in an individual's navel using a __Horizontal Bar Chart__
- Visualize a voluteer's wash frequency using a __Gauge Chart__
- Visualize the bacteria cultures per sample using a __Bubble Chart__


## Resources
The resouces used develope this JavaScript application included;
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- JavaScript/JavaScript Events
- BootStrap
- D3 (Data-Driven Documents)
- Sample.json (JSON data file)

## Results
All sprints were completed as scheduled and I delivered on all client expectations/results.

## Summary
My client is extremely pleased with the final sprint and the release of their updated dashboard.   Probable Beef (PB) has decided to hire me as their "Data Engineer" to assist with their growth and decision making for their business.  As you can see, the final dashboard does include a great constrasting background color and is extremley easy on the eyes.  As you change the subject ID of volunteers, you will notice each visualization changes to represent the correlation based on the volunteer.
